# Star Notary V1
- Created my own local token and testing it on Local Ganache
- Tested all the functionality of the token locally

For this you will need to use the latest version of Truffle and Metamask

- Truffle: Truffle v5.0.2 - a development framework for Ethereum
- Metamask: 5.3.1

If you need to update truffle to the latest version use:
`npm install -g truffle`

If you need to update Metamask just delete your Metamask extension and install it again.
